# renovate-yarnrc

This is a minimal reproduction for
<https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/issues/19163>.

Compare the diffs (and commits) between the PR [generated by
Renovate](https://github.com/joelmukuthu/renovate-yarnrc/pull/5) to upgrade
fastify to v4.10.2 and the PR where I do the [update
manually](https://github.com/joelmukuthu/renovate-yarnrc/pull/6), wherein I also
update the version of fastify referenced in `packageExtensions` in the
`.yarnrc.yml` file. Note that in the latter PR, the yarn.lock entry for
`fastify@npm:4.9.2` also gets removed.
